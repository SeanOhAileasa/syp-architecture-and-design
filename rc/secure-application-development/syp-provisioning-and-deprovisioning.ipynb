    "Provisioning is the process of making something available - if you are provisioning an application, then you’re probably going to deploy a web server, a database server, there may be a middleware server and other configuration and settings to be able to use this particular application. That’s one of the reasons why, when we describe the deployment of an application, we’re referring to it as an application instance, because it usually involves many different components all working together.\n",

    "Of course, the provisioning of this application instance also includes security components. We want to be sure that the operating system and the application are up to date with the latest security patches.\n",

    "If we’re deploying software to a workstation, we may want to run our own scans of that software and make sure there’s nothing inside of that binary that may look malicious - this also would be a good time to check the security posture of the workstation and make sure that the workstation itself is up to date with the latest patches and is running all of the latest security configurations."

    "When we first build this application instance, we’re creating a particular level of scalability. We know that based on the particular web server, database server, and all of the other components that make up this application instance, that we can support a certain load, for example, you might build an application instance that can handle 100,000 transactions per second and everything that you put together would be able to handle any load up to that point.\n",

    "But if an application becomes very popular, you may find that 100,000 transactions per second isn’t enough - maybe you need to increase the capabilities of this application to support 500,000 transactions per second - to be able to do that, we may deploy multiple application instances - that increase or even decrease of available resources for an application refers to elasticity. \n",
