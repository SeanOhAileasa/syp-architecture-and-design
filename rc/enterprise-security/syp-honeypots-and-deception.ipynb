    "This is more commonly used, however, to provide intelligence for the security professional - we know that there are certain sites that a user will visit if they happen to be infected with a type of malware, so instead of allowing that user to communicate to that external server, we’ll instead configure a DNS sinkhole and if anyone ever requests the IP address of that malicious site, we will provide it with an IP address of a machine inside of our location that we can then create a report on to determine who might be infected with this malware in our organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a function that’s often integrated into an intrusion prevention device or next-generation firewall - if someone tries to communicate out to one of these known malicious sites, the DNS sinkhole will send an IP address that redirects them to a known good site and this also will create an alert, or an alarm, so that the security team within the organization will know that a particular device is infected with this malware. \n",
